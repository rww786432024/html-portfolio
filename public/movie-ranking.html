<h1>The Best movies according to Ryan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p>Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan work well together the comedy and action is very refreshing.</p>
<h3>Terminator 2 Judgement Day</h3>
<p>Arnold is perfect as the T800 that protect instead of terminating target. His comedy and presence in the movie makes it action packed and edge of your seat.</p>
<h3>Equalibrium</h3>
<p>The movie is like the matrix with more feeling and you support Christian Bale's character.</p>
